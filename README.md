# hello-world
My first project on Github, learning the ropes.
# My name is Sebastian Garcia, I'm an apsiring coder, and here are a few things about me!
- I have two cool sisters, and an awesome Mom and Papa.
- I'm a Jehovah's Witness, and love seeing God's creation in nature and rain.
- My favorite type of music is movie and video game soundtracks.
- And this is a test for branch edits, and pull requests!
